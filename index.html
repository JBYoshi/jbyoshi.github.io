    I think the part I like about other websites is not so much that there's less white
    as that the content takes up all of the page.

    My name is Jonathan Browne. I'm an experienced software developer and a computer science
    student at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm currently a freshman, but I've been
    programming since elementary school.
</p>

<p>
    I work on <a href="https://www.spongepowered.org">Sponge</a>, an open-source plugin API for
    Minecraft servers. I've been involved with the project since 2015, and have served as a core
    developer since 2017.
</p>

<p>
    I'm currently part of UT Austin's <a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/fri">Freshman Research
    Initiative</a> in the Autonomous Robotics stream. In the spring of my freshman year, I helped
    create a <a href="https://glitch.com/~bwi-status-board">robot status board website</a> for the
    university's Building-Wide Intelligence research laboratory.
</p>

<p>
    I'm naturally quiet and thoughtful. I'm very curious; in my spare time, I enjoy learning about
    and experimenting with different technologies. I also try to be helpful and ethical whenever
    possible.
</p>
