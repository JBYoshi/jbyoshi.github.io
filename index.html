    Hi! I'm Jonathan Browne. I'm a software developer at Amazon. I've spent my whole life designing,
    building, and digging into computer systems.
</p>

<p>
    I'm naturally quiet and thoughtful. I'm very curious; in my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with
    different technologies and learning how they work. I also try to be helpful and ethical whenever
    possible.
