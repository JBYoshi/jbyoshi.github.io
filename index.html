    Hi! I'm Jonathan Browne. I'm an experienced software developer and a masters student in the
    University of Texas at Austin's Integrated 5-Year Computer Science BS/MS Program. Since elementary
    school, I've been designing, building, and digging into computer systems.
</p>

<p>
    I'm naturally quiet and thoughtful. I'm very curious; in my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with
    different technologies and learning how they work. I also try to be helpful and ethical whenever
    possible.
</p>

<p>
    I'll be graduating in May 2024, and I'm <a href="/contact">currently looking for a full-time position</a>.
    In the meantime, you can find me around the UT campus as an engineering officer in the
    <a href="https://isss.io">Information and Systems Security Society (ISSS)</a>, or in the
    <a href="https://linktr.ee/longhorngaming">Longhorn Gaming</a> Legend of Zelda and Splatoon communities.
    Feel free to find me in person and say hi, or look for me online by the username JBYoshi.

            <b><a href="https://www.spongepowered.org">SpongePowered</a></b>:
            In 2015, I first became involved in open-source work through several contributions to Sponge,
            an open-source plugin API for Minecraft servers. I became a core developer in 2017, where I worked
            on maintaining the API and implementation and reviewing community-submitted issues and pull requests.
