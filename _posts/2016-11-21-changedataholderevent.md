title: ChangeDataHolderEvent
---

I've recently taken on the challenge of implementing the biggest event in Sponge: [`ChangeDataHolderEvent`](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeCommon/issues/742#issuecomment-261692920). It's very difficult and confusing.

I've pushed a few minor API changes to [my SpongeAPI fork](https://github.com/JBYoshi/SpongeAPI/tree/data-events). I'll post here as I work on it.
