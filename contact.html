    <h1>Contact Me</h1>

    <p>
        The best way to reach me is through the contact form here. You can also reach me through
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-browne/">LinkedIn</a>, but I don't generally
        accept connection requests from people I don't already know.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you fill this out, I'll reply via email within a few days.

        <i>Privacy note: When you submit this form, I'll also collect your IP address and browser
        version to make it harder for people to spam me. Only I, my spam detector, my web hosting
        providers, and my email providers will see what you submit, and it's only used so I can
        reply to you. I don't sell this data or use it to spam you.</i>
