Hi! I'm Jonathan Browne. I'm a proficient computer programmer and video game enthusiast. I have written programs in many programming languages, including Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Groovy, Kotlin, and Lua, and also have some knowledge of Rust, Scala, C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift.

I am most known for my work on [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org), a plugin API for the video game Minecraft, where I go by the username JBYoshi. I have contributed to Sponge since [June 2015](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeCommon/pull/72), and became a core developer in [July 2017](https://discordapp.com/channels/142425412096491520/303772747907989504/333800036024451073). I continue to be involved with Sponge to this day.

In my spare time, I play video games like [Screeps](https://screeps.com), or research new and emerging technologies like encryption, VR, and artificial intelligence.
