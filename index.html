    I think the part I like about other websites is not so much that there's less white
    as that the content takes up all of the page.

    My name is Jonathan Browne. I'm an experienced software developer and a student in the
    University of Texas at Austin's Integrated 5-Year Computer Science BS/MS Program. I'm currently
    entering my fourth year at UT, but I've been programming since elementary school.
</p>

<p>
    I work on <a href="https://www.spongepowered.org">Sponge</a>, an open-source plugin API for
    Minecraft servers. I've been involved with the project since 2015, and have served as a core
    developer since 2017.
</p>

<p>
    In 2020, I was part of UT Austin's <a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/fri">Freshman Research
    Initiative</a> in the Autonomous Robotics stream. For the spring, I helped build a prototype
    <a href="https://glitch.com/~bwi-status-board">robot status board website</a> for the
    university's Building-Wide Intelligence research laboratory. Over the summer, I helped with
    several additional projects at UT inside and outside the BWI lab - an experiment for robots and
    humans passing each other in a hallway, a
    <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/outreach/camps/robotics">virtual robotics camp</a> for high
    school students, and a <a href="https://github.com/SonyAI/PandemicSimulator">pandemic
    simulator</a> which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7jNchKo690">was published</a> as
    part of the <a href="https://ai-for-socialgood.github.io/">AAAI Fall 2020 Symposium - AI for
    Social Good</a>. In the fall, I started collaborating on a machine project that analyzes human
    motion to predict a person's trajectory, which I have been continuing since while serving as a
    peer mentor.
</p>

<p>
    Last summer, I worked as an intern at <a href="https://vectra.ai">Vectra</a>. I worked on
    enhancements to customer-facing and internal reporting systems and worked on several internal
    security hardening features.
</p>

<p>
    This summer, I am interning at Amazon in their
    <a href="https://www.amazon.science/tag/supply-chain-optimization-technologies">Supply Chain
    Optimization Technologies team.</a> I am designing and implementing a system to predict the
    effectiveness of different configurations for their global transportation network.
</p>

<p>
    I'm naturally quiet and thoughtful. I'm very curious; in my spare time, I enjoy learning about
    and experimenting with different technologies. I also try to be helpful and ethical whenever
    possible.
</p>

<p>
    The best way to get in touch with me is through <a href="/contact">email</a>. I'm also on
    <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jonathan-browne">LinkedIn</a>, and you can find many of my
    projects on <a href="https://github.com/JBYoshi">GitHub</a>, and
    <a href="https://glitch.com/@JBYoshi">Glitch</a.
