Gradle Grab is a simple, automatically-updating Gradle installation for Windows.

Just download it and add `gradle.exe` to your PATH.

Windows only at the moment, but a JAR file is provided for anyone who wants to package it on another platform. A JVM may or may not be required (I haven't tested), but you probably have one anyways if you're using Gradle.
