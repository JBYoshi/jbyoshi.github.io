Block Dodge is a simple game where you try to dodge blocks.

### Controls
- Arrow keys/Mouse: Move
- Space or Enter: Start/Continue
- F11: Toggle fullscreen
- Escape: Pause/Continue
- Delete: Quit

### Playing
When you're playing, new blocks will enter the screen from the sides. They will stay onscreen and will bounce off of the walls. You cannot go offscreen, either; you won't bounce, you'll just stop.

When two blocks collide, they will explode. The drops from the explosion are just as deadly as the blocks they came from, just smaller. They will also shrink and disappear, so you're not completely out of luck if you're cornered by an explosion.

### Scoring
Your score will increase over time. To keep things balanced between players of different screen sizes, your score will increase slower on larger screens.
