    I think the part I like about other websites is not so much that there's less white
    as that the content takes up all of the page.

    My name is Jonathan Browne. I'm an experienced software developer and a computer science
    student at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm currently a sophomore, but I've been
    programming since elementary school.
</p>

<p>
    I work on <a href="https://www.spongepowered.org">Sponge</a>, an open-source plugin API for
    Minecraft servers. I've been involved with the project since 2015, and have served as a core
    developer since 2017.
</p>

<p>
    In 2020, I was part of UT Austin's <a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/fri">Freshman Research
    Initiative</a> in the Autonomous Robotics stream. For the spring, I helped build a prototype
    <a href="https://glitch.com/~bwi-status-board">robot status board website</a> for the
    university's Building-Wide Intelligence research laboratory. Over the summer, I helped with
    several additional projects at UT inside and outside the BWI lab - an experiment for robots and
    humans passing each other in a hallway, a
    <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/outreach/camps/robotics">virtual robotics camp</a> for high
    school students, and a <a href="https://github.com/SonyAI/PandemicSimulator">pandemic
    simulator</a> which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7jNchKo690">was published</a> as
    part of the <a href="https://ai-for-socialgood.github.io/">AAAI Fall 2020 Symposium - AI for
    Social Good</a>. In the fall, I started collaborating on a machine project that analyzes human
    motion to predict a person's trajectory, which I have been continuing since while serving as a
    peer mentor.
</p>

<p>
    Last summer, I worked as an intern at <a href="https://vectra.ai">Vectra</a>. I worked on
    enhancements to customer-facing and internal reporting systems and worked on several internal
    security hardening features.
</p>

<p>
    For the upcoming summer, I have accepted a position as a software engineer intern at Amazon.
</p>

<p>
    I'm naturally quiet and thoughtful. I'm very curious; in my spare time, I enjoy learning about
    and experimenting with different technologies. I also try to be helpful and ethical whenever
    possible.
</p>
