## Website

When you visit this website or any of my other websites, I may collect and store the following information:

* Information you specifically type in, for example on my contact form, with your permission each time
* Your computer's IP address
* Your browser's user agent (usually its name and version, which may also include your computer's operating system and version)
* Which pages you visit on my site, and how long you spend on them
* The page that linked you to my page, which may be on a different website
* The links you click on my website

I may also share this information with services I use to run and protect my website. Currently, those services are:

* [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
* [Akismet](https://akismet.com/privacy/)

I and my service providers may use or share the information we collect only to run, improve, maintain, and protect our services, as required by law, or when any personally-identifying information is removed. Information collected is specifically **not** sold or used for targeted advertising.
