I'm a proficient computer programmer and a freshman studying computer science at the University of Texas at Austin. Since the age of 7, I have written programs in many programming languages, such as Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Groovy, Kotlin, Lua, and C++.

I'm naturally curious. I enjoy learning how things work and researching new technologies. I also try to be helpful and ethical whenever I can.

## My Projects

### [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org)

An open-source, community-driven plugin API for Minecraft servers. I have contributed to Sponge since 2015 and have been an active core developer since 2017.
